C2Py Struct converter
=====================

C2Py is there to help you convert your C structs and unions to Python classes with the same fields, names types and everything!
That's not all though. C2Py can receive a buffer of bytes to assign to the struct's fields!
Why use it? It could be most likely be used for testing or debugging a C project.
Or perhaps for reading and understanding a memory dump better by reviving it into readable struct-like classes.
